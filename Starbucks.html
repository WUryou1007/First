  <h3>Why I started</h3>
  <div>When I was in the 1st year in the university, I strugle to make friends and manage myself because I moved to Tokyo from rural town, started live alone and could not get used to a new life. To overcome these problems, I thought about starting working at Starbucks as a barista.</div>
